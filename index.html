    <h1><strong>Hello World!<strong></h1>
    <h2>Me</h2>
      <p>I am Sky Luo, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.</p>
    <h2>Why this class</h2>
      <p>I am taking this class because website development skills, or at least the ability to read codes in html, JavaScript and etc, are important for my career as a software developers in the future.</p>
    <h2>My coding experience</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>I have taken CSC 121 and thus proficient in python.</li>
      <li>I was also involved in the <strong>DRIVE Lab</strong> reseach on the gender representation in the
        <em>CHI (Computer-Human Interaction)</em> conference, where I collected data through python web mining
        package Beautiful Soup</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>My goals in this course is to be proficient in multiple website programming languages
        and be able to independently design and produce actual websites.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
      <div>
        <a href="https://www.exhaustingacrowd.com/gwangju">Exhausting a Crowd</a>
        <p>This website allows its users to track what's happening in different cities around the world through cameras.
          One cool thing about this project is that while it displays the live video,
          it also tracks what people are doing and automatically generate a floating description of the person's movement.
           It might have employed machine learning into the website to analyze physical behaviors.
           I also want to develop websites alike that harness more complicated computing functions into the web experience.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">How Bad is Your Spotify?</a>
        <p>This website uses your music account (Spotify or Apple Music) to analyze your music taste and rate your taste out of 100.
          I think it is cool because the website requires user input and could connect to other platforms (Spotify/Apple Music)
          to extract and analyze data through AI. Like I have said for the last project, I would love to diversify the functions
        of my website into kinds like AI machine learning and cross-platform interaction.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <a href="https://www.sociality.today/">Sociality.today</a>
        <p>This website is a conceptual artwork that reveal technology contributing to
          "the social control, manipulation, and surveillance at play on the Internet." This is inspirational
          because of its purpose for greater social-technological justice. It is extremely relevant today since
        we start to realize how absurdly dependent upon big techs we are and how they are exploiting us through our dependence on them.</p>
      </div>
    <h2>Comment on the Assignment Difficulty</h2>
      <p>The instruction on the assignment is a bit confusing.</p>
