    <h2>Why this class</h2>
    <pre>
          I am taking this class because website development skills,
          or at least the ability to read codes in html, JavaScript
          and etc, are important for my career as a software developers in the future.

    <h2>My coding experience</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I have taken CSC 121 and thus proficient in python.</li>
      <li>I was also involved in the <strong>DRIVE Lab</strong> reseach on the gender representation in the
        <em>CHI (Computer-Human Interaction)</em> conference, where I collected data through python web mining
        package Beautiful Soup
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goals in this course is to be proficient in multiple website programming languages
      and be able to independently design and produce actual websites.</p>

    <h2>Learn Computing Activties Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <pre><li>
            During the file naming convention activity, I learned how to meaningfully and neatly name my files so that
            they would be more understandable to my collaborators and future self and the changes made to the original
            documents would be correctly (in terms of timeline and versions) recorded. More specifically, I leanrned to
            use descriptive names and avoid ambiguous abbreivations as well as appending th date to edits. For instance,
            instead of using "Econ Paper Final", use "econ-exchange-rate-paper-20220901". As you can see, filename should
            be lower-case and the symbol "-" is a better separator for texts in filename than spaces. At last, I learned
            to organize my folders in hierachy so it would be easier to organize and find files.
          </li></pre>

      <pre><li>
            During the Command Line activity, I understood and explored the functionality of the Terminal/Command Line.
            For instance, I realized it is a more direct and powerful way to monitor or make changes to your computer
            environment, as well as a direct space to utilize git version control. More specifically, I learned to use
            different commands such as echo, ls, pwd, mkdir, cd, touch, nano, and etc.
          </li></pre>
      <pre><li>
            During the Git version control activity, I learned the definition of Git and why is it a crucial and powerful
            tool for multi-collaborators operations. It provides a convenient and organized way to record every edits made
            to the original documents and allow a variety of functionality such as branches.
          </li></pre>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div>
      <a href="https://www.exhaustingacrowd.com/gwangju">Exhausting a Crowd</a>
      <p>This website allows its users to track what's happening in different cities around the world through cameras.
        One cool thing about this project is that while it displays the live video,
        it also tracks what people are doing and automatically generate a floating description of the person's movement.
        It might have employed machine learning into the website to analyze physical behaviors.
        I also want to develop websites alike that harness more complicated computing functions into the web experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">How Bad is Your Spotify?</a>
      <p>This website uses your music account (Spotify or Apple Music) to analyze your music taste and rate your taste out of 100.
        I think it is cool because the website requires user input and could connect to other platforms (Spotify/Apple Music)
        to extract and analyze data through AI. Like I have said for the last project, I would love to diversify the functions
        of my website into kinds like AI machine learning and cross-platform interaction. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <a href="https://www.sociality.today/">Sociality.today</a>
      <p>This website is a conceptual artwork that reveal technology contributing to
        "the social control, manipulation, and surveillance at play on the Internet." This is inspirational
        because of its purpose for greater social-technological justice. It is extremely relevant today since
        we start to realize how absurdly dependent upon big techs we are and how they are exploiting us through our dependence on them.</p>

    <!-- Comment on the Assignment Difficulty
            Once I committed the changes I could not change the commit message afterwards.
            It is a problem when I forget to include commit messages.
            The image would not display even though the codes seem fine.
